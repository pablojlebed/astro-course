# Astro Course - Finished Module Files

Welcome to the **Astro Course - Finished Module Files** repository.

This repository serves as a companion to the main Astro course content, which you can find on my website:

‚û°Ô∏è **Access the full course text here:** [Astro Course](https://www.pablolebed.dev/resources/courses/astro/astro/)

Disclaimer: Since I learn best through reading, and often struggle to find quality learning material in that format, I started creating my own using **language models**. This is an example.

## üìö What's in This Repository?

This repository will host the **finished code for each module** of the Astro course. As you progress through the lessons on my site, you can refer to these files to check your work, review implemented concepts, or get a head start on the next section.

Each module's completed project state will be available, allowing you to:

- **Review:** See how concepts are applied in a working project.
- **Compare:** Check your code against the finished version.
- **Catch Up:** Quickly get to a specific module's starting point if you missed a step.

## üöÄ How to Use These Files

1. **Clone the repository:**
   
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[Your-GitHub-Username]/astro-course.git
    cd astro-course
    ```
    
    *(Remember to replace `[Your-GitHub-Username]` with your actual GitHub username.)*
    
3. **Navigate to a specific module's files:**
Finished files for each module will be organized into dedicated branches or folders (e.g., `module-0-finished`, `module-1-finished`). You'll find instructions on how to access these specific files within the corresponding module on the course website.

4. **Install dependencies (for a specific module's folder):**
Once in a module's project directory,

    ```bash
    npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
   ```
    
5. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev # or pnpm dev or yarn dev
    ```
    
    This will launch the completed module's project, usually accessible at `http://localhost:4321`.
