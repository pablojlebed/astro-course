      Hello! I'm a passionate web developer dedicated to building beautiful,
      performant, and accessible web applications. My journey in web development
      started with a curiosity for how things work on the internet, and it
      quickly grew into a love for crafting digital experiences.

      I believe in continuous learning and always strive to stay updated with
      the latest technologies and best practices. When I'm not coding, you can
      find me exploring new frameworks, contributing to open source, or enjoying
      a good book.
