    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">About Me</h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
      A long, long time ago in a far distant galaxy, I had to decide between a
      career and a hobby.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
      I chose the path of science — Analytical Chemistry — and spent years
      solving real-world problems with data and precision. But time passed, and
      the question of doing what truly makes you happy could no longer be
      delayed.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
      So I returned to that old spark: building things on computers.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
      Today, I’m a Frontend Developer focused on creating clean, accessible, and
      performant websites. I love learning, experimenting, and turning ideas
      into real projects. Whether it’s React, Astro, or server-side tinkering, I
      approach code the same way I approached science: with curiosity,
      discipline, and care.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
      When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me enjoying family, gaming,
      playing with Linux servers, or thinking about the next thing I want to
      build.
